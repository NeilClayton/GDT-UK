								<h6>Hazard Perception</h6>
								<p>In November  2002 the Hazard Perception Test was introduced to test your ability in spotting developing hazards on the road ahead. This part of the test involves you watching a series of video clips and clicking on the mouse once you have spotted the developing hazard. You can score a maximum of 5 points per hazard for spotting the hazard early enough and then scoring down 4 points, 3 points , 2 points, and 1 point, you will score 0 points if you have not spotted the hazard. If you are seen to be pressing the mouse too many times (trying to cheat the system) the computer will tell you that you have pressed the mouse inappropriately and you will score 0 points. </p>
								<p>You must pass both the Driving Theory Test and Hazard Perception Test at the same time to pass.
								There are many ways for you to study for this, you can either purchase a CD rom from your local supermarket, amazon, or any book stores. You can purchase the Driving Theory Test books from the same places as mentioned previously. Or alternatively you can practice on the internet.</p>
